Unirest.io
===========

Today we released our newest open source project, which we called unicorn, unfortunately that was also the name of two other open source projects.  We really dropped the ball there, and have been working hard to clean up the mess.

To remedy the situation we changed the project name to unirest, which suits the project even better in my opinion.  Also we built a new website with a cool space theme and have updated all of the docs and github repos.

I'd like to personally apologize to anyone who was confused or pissed off.  Hopefully you can look past our mistake and see the value in this project. 

### What problem does Unirest solve?

We’ve noticed that a lot of people have trouble wrapping their head around using public and private API’s. With API keys, varying fundamental architechture, differing response types, etc… there is a lot to think about. 

Unirest tries to simplify the process by abstracting a lot of the boilerplate and focusing on the core REST verbs that we all know and love (GET, POST, PUT, UPDATE, DELETE). Similarly it’s methods and response structure are the same in all the supported languages. It works for all REST API's, available on our own mashape API marketplace and abroad. 

We truly believe that APIs are changing the way we make software and by extension the world at large. Never has so much power been in the hands of a solo developer with an idea.

May the force be with you,

Montana &amp; the rest of the mashape team.
